                During the late 1960s, after graduating from UC Davis (BA, 1966; MA, 1967) and moving to New York,
                Stephen
                Kaltenbach established a reputation in the emerging international field of Conceptual art. But in 1970,
                just as
                he was achieving career success, Kaltenbach abruptly withdrew to California’s Central Valley, appearing
                to abandon Conceptual work in
                favor of the more traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of
                his
                “dropout,” this exhibition considers Kaltenbach’s engagement with time as a principal theme across his
                remarkably diverse
                career, which encompasses bronze time capsules, advertisements placed anonymously in Artforum magazine
                in
                1968-69, and the monumental photorealist painting Portrait of My Father (1972-79)
